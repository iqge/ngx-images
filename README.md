*Ever experienced broken image like*

![Image example](https://static.havemybooks.com/external/broken-image.png)

If ever this happen that you loose your image but there will always be a backup for you. We've added an extra feature which will boost your page load time to upto 10X. As we load the image after the page load successfully so you angular app will turn much faster using this plugin.

## Getting Started

    npm install ngx-images --save

        Then in your code `app.module.ts`
        
        import { NgxImagesModule } from  'ngx-images';

	    @NgModule({    
		    imports: [
		    ...otherImports,    
		    NgxImagesModule 
		    ]
	    })

Then in your code `app.component.ts`

    import { NgxImagesService, ImageConfig } from 'ngx-images';
    localConfig:  ImageConfig  = { imageFallbackPath:  'https://www.gstatic.com/webp/gallery3/1.png',
		addLoader:  true,
		loader:  'rotating-plane',
		pageLoadBoost:  true
	};

    constructor(public  imgHelper:  NgxImagesService) {}    

    ngOnInit() {
		    this.imgHelper.setGlobal({ imageFallbackPath:  'https://www.gstatic.com/webp/gallery3/2.png',    
		    addLoader:  true,    
		    loader:  'rotating-plane',    
		    pageLoadBoost:  true    
	    });    
    }
Then in your code `app.component.scss`

    @import  '~ngx-images/loader';

Then in your code `app.component.html`

    <strong>This doesn't look good</strong>
    <img src="i_am_not_here.jpg">

    <strong>Replace below image with your logo</strong>
    <span> <- At least one parent of image with single child is important
        <img src='asfd.jpg' ngxImages>
    </span>
